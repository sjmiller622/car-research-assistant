# car-research-assistant/sjmiller622

This project is to AUTOMATE MY EXISTING MANUAL CONSULTING PROCESS. 

VISION: Help people make SETTLED choices when it comes to selecting a USED CAR, or to better weigh costs when selecting between a used or new car.

MISSION: My mission is to help people determine what their budget should be, which cars they should consider and why, and what would be their expected costs for a certain car in a certain market based on their initial description of their choice of car. 

GOAL: I want to create a more robust way of capturing information that is useful during my browsing session without manually populating a spreadsheet with the required car information. 

PROCESS: Research 6-10 used cars in the local market, then research the reliability using a different site, then research consumer experiences using yet another site, then research repair costs using another site. 

ENDING: I need an assistant to capture all of these things during appropriate browsing sessions so it only takes as long as the browsing session and not the manual labor of copying, pasting, and post processing/calculating.
